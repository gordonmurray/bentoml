# CLIP Image Vectorizer with BentoML

This project provides an API for vectorizing images using OpenAI's CLIP model using BentoML. It allows you to send images to the API and receive a vector representation that encodes meaningful features of the image.

The processor automatically resizes images to the model's expected input dimensions (e.g., 224x224 for this model) and normalizes pixel values.

## Features
- Easy-to-use REST API for image vectorization.
- Powered by the OpenAI CLIP model.
- Serves vectorization directly from BentoML.
- Ready for local testing.

## Supported Image Formats

The service supports the following image formats based on Pillow's capabilities:

| **Format**      | **File Extensions**         | **Description**                                                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **JPEG**        | `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.jpe`     | Common format with lossy compression, widely used for photographs.          |
| **PNG**         | `.png`                      | Lossless compression, supports transparency (alpha channel).                |
| **BMP**         | `.bmp`, `.dib`              | Bitmap image format, uncompressed.                                          |
| **GIF**         | `.gif`                      | Supports animation and transparency; only the first frame is processed.     |
| **TIFF**        | `.tiff`, `.tif`             | Flexible format supporting multiple layers and compression options.         |
| **PPM**         | `.ppm`, `.pgm`, `.pbm`      | Portable Pixmap formats (NetPBM).                                           |
| **ICO**         | `.ico`                      | Icon format, often used for application icons.                              |
| **WEBP**        | `.webp`                     | Modern image format for web usage, supports both lossy and lossless modes.  |
| **DDS**         | `.dds`                      | DirectDraw Surface, used for textures in graphics applications.             |
| **TGA**         | `.tga`                      | Targa format, often used in video games and graphics.                       |
| **HDR**         | `.hdr`                      | High Dynamic Range image format, used for realistic lighting.               |
| **JPEG 2000**   | `.jp2`, `.j2k`, `.jpx`      | Advanced JPEG format with better compression.                               |

## Local install

1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install transformers Pillow torch bentoml
   ```

---

## Run a Local Service

1. Start the BentoML service:
   ```bash
   bentoml serve service:svc
   ```
2. Verify the service is running:
   - Health Check:
     ```bash
     curl -v http://127.0.0.1:3000/livez
     ```
   - Metrics:
     ```bash
     curl http://127.0.0.1:3000/metrics
     ```

---

## Vectorize an Image

Send an image to the API and receive a vector representation:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" --data-binary @image.jpg http://127.0.0.1:3000/vectorize
```

The response will be a JSON object containing the image vector:
